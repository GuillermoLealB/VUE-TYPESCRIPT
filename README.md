In SRC/components is there my component with all my progrmation using vue.
For obviously reason i dont built the project , because it is necessary that i show you the components

This was an interesting project , i had to learn more about vue for develop it , im a programmer autodidact and i always wanna learn more and more because im fall in love with the progrmation, i want to put all my knowledge and time in real projects, for to develop my skills and learn how to be better in the area.
Note: i also know how to work with composition api ,
and i learn about more of VITE and Pinia but for now i try to maintain all in a fundamental bases, for to show you that i can understand how it works


I am fully disposed to have learned other ways and negotiate my opportunity to work with you, I consider that I have a good logic programming, so if there is another type of project that I can participate in, I will be very grateful if you give me the opportunity to demonstrate my skills.
